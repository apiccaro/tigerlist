This version: 
- Branch copied from demo-monday on 4/10/24.
- demo-monday was a slightly tweaked copy of Jay-B6, which holds pretty much all work since Block 4. No meaningful difference between them.
- Will merge in Jack's documentation. A lot will be outdated but I'll match his conventions and update as I go through.

- Everything works in current state, response bodies still break when cas is toggled on.
- Not planning to add any functionality changes or improvements

To Do:
- Add j_moran scripts, j_moran/tests, and whatever other psql stuff is worth hanging onto
- Check if this is as much as annika wants to document her code
- Clean up main tigerlist folder
- If Lucy writes more scripts, make sure to get them added
- Replace README.txt (this doc) with contents of readme-for-final.txt, and update its contents substantially.

Done:
- Add all of Jack's documentation.
- Make SMTP code more modular, update documentation. 
- Make api code (mainly database methods) modular.
- Remove vestigial methods, comment tests or test references to tests.
