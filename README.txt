To Do:
- Replace README.txt (this doc) with contents of readme-for-final.txt, and update its contents substantially.

- Add j_moran scripts, j_moran/tests, and whatever other psql stuff is worth hanging onto
- If Lucy writes more scripts, make sure to get them added as well
- Check if this is as much as annika wants to document her code. if so, someone should probably go through and comment a bit.
- Clean up main tigerlist folder

Done:
- Add all of Jack's documentation.
- Make SMTP code more modular, update documentation. 
- Make api code (mainly database methods) modular.
- Remove vestigial methods, comment tests or test references to tests.
