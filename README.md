TigerList is a website for Colorado College to buy, sell and exchange goods. Mimicking an online marketplace, TigerList allows only Colorado College students to buy and sell goods. Instead of other online marketplaces, TigerList guarantees products are within walking distance, are in safe locations and are amongst other students. This increases safety of students and reusability of any item on campus. Colorado College students have no single interface to message each other about buying and selling goods. Messages end up in class GroupMes or Instagram stories or by word of mouth. TigerList is a confluence for students to buy and sell goods without going to extreme measures. 
The website has a Colorado College sign in with Duopush to confirm a studentâ€™s identity. From there, the student can browse listings and sort them, make a listing, and edit one of their personal listings. Based on other online marketplaces, TigerList has a familiarity that students can easily navigate.
