At some point we need to nail down exactly what methods we'll be using to get DB information to the pages. 
The dictionary also really shouldnt change after that
Here are some methods I feel like i'd want if I was doing front end

getUser(email) - Return user or null
getPost(    ) - Return Post or null
writePost() - 

getAllUsers() - Return list of all users (is there a max size?) - maybe we dont need this
getAllPosts() - Return list of all posts  

getUserPosts(email) - Return all posts by a given user
getPostSearch(“search terms”) - return posts with matching content in title or description.
getCategoryPosts(ID) - return posts matching a category, indicated by numeric system

getSearchPrice() - Search by price (default to ascending)
getSearchAge() - Search by age (default to new?)
