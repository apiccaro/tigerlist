db_instructions.txt - more detailed info on database shell commands and code use

db_tests.js - set of tests from before we had api setup
modAddRem.js - annika's script to add and remove moderators. Outdated api use
modifyImages.js - allows user to replace image file names for a listing
sendTestMessage.js - uses test table to verify querying functionality

showAllPosts.js - prints all posts
show[something].js - these use similar code to showAllPosts.js, displaying the specified database content.

showNewPosts.sh - used to print recent posts in a format specified by user. 
More helpful when it sat in a different directory than the scripts it called.
